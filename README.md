# Alexa Skill

This is the repo for the Alexa Skill that I have designed. The name of the Skill is Pay it Forward which uses some of Amazon's services such as S3, Lambda and of course the Developers Console. The idea is very simple every day a user will ask their Amazon Alexa enabled device what their goal is for the day and Alexa will repeat what is in the database. The goal of the app is to get people in to very altruistic habits so that they can focus on bettering the lives of one another rather than just themselves. Alexa Skills right now are able to be wirtten in Python and in Node.js I chose to write it using Node.js as I'm familiar with Javascript. The Skill works by first checking for the date. Based on the date it will retireve the corresponding Goal of the Day that is stored in Dynamo DB another one of Amazons services the schema for each other the Goals for the Day are written using JSON which contain a message that Alexa will repeat to the user, a date so that everyone can get the same goal every day, and two picture links that are referencing pictures stored in a S3 server that will be used for the card. The card that is exporteed uses a picture of my design that has the message of the day so that users will be able to keep track of what they're trying to accomplish.
